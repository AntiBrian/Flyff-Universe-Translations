Welcome, adventurers! #bStory mode#nb dungeons have monsters with reduced attack, health, and experience compared to the normal version of a dungeon.

Players may use Story mode difficulty to complete quests with friends, or enjoy a casual stroll through the scenario in a #blow risk#nb environment. Enjoy!

- Masquerpets in Story mode dungeons do not drop items
- Pet cages and treasure chests do not spawn in Story mode
- Players do not earn achievement credit in Story mode
